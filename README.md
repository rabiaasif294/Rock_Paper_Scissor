### 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors: Game Description

**Rock-Paper-Scissors** is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:

- ✊ **Rock** – a closed fist  
- ✋ **Paper** – an open hand  
- ✌️ **Scissors** – a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V

#### 🧠 Game Rules:

- **Rock beats Scissors** (Rock crushes Scissors)  
- **Scissors beats Paper** (Scissors cut Paper)  
- **Paper beats Rock** (Paper covers Rock)

If both players choose the same shape, the game is a **draw**.

The game is often used as a quick decision-making method, similar to drawing straws or flipping a coin. In digital versions, the player competes against the computer, which makes random choices.
